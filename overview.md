Successful traits of a data scientist
============

A data scientist needs to be able to juggle several competing abilities.

  * **A constant pursuit of learning**. With the variety of problems related to 
    data analysis, analytics, and insight automation, it is inavoidable to 
    continue to maintain a healthy academic appetite.

    Be aware that this kind of hunger for knowledge must be balanced across
    three categories: statistics, engineering, and domain. To avoid many
    pitfalls and continue exploring the best techniques, you will have to
    indefinitely build a strong understanding of [statistical principles](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).

    To actually have an impact, your work needs to be modular, reproducible,
    testable, and implementable, and this will require you to stay abreast
    of both the latest technologies *and* the latest in best development 
    practices (not the same thing!). If you fail to write code or build frameworks
    that are re-usable across projects and enforce testing and continuous 
    integration, you will soon be swamped by maintenance and complexity.

    Finally, the most difficult ongoing learning to maintain is the exploration
    of the particular domain you are approaching with data science. Coming
    from a technical background, there will be an infinite well of sexy statistical
    and engineering ideas, but to prioritize projects of highest value you
    will have to continue building your understanding of the application domain.

  * **Optimistic stubborness**. Performing the first analysis is easy. Tweaking
    your dependent variable for the tenth time or questioning the integrity of
    some data points or variables is hard, and requires a persistent knack for
    understanding when additional value can be extracted from trying to 
    answer a given question.

    This stubborness should be heteroskedastic and its magnitude vary as
    a size of project importance!

  * **The ability to prioritize**. With every additional data source available
    for your domain, there will be an exponentially growing number of features
    and derivative projects. A good data scientist (especially at a smaller company)
    will operate with surgical precision on first tackling the questions that
    can have the most immediate impact, and be comfortable with saying no
    to every other request.

  * **Compromise and pragmatism**. A data scientist should not be a perfectionist,
    because the sheer combination of potential applications means a 5 things 80%
    of the way will far outweight 1 thing 95% of the way. One should be capable
    of performing something quickly and moving on.

  * **Skepticism and a good intuition**. Unfortunately, in this line of work, most
    of the time surprising or unexpected insights will be the result of a bug
    in your code (or even someone else's code, or the data provided to you), 
    rather than a legitimate phenomenon.

    One has to be extremely careful to guard against overfitting and making sure
    results are comparable. For example, if you train two models and compare their
    performance, you have to be careful to assess performance *only on the data points
    that were not in the training set for either model*.

    Sometimes, results are just plain statistically wrong, sometimes unintuitively so.
    For example, did you know that given two highly correlated variables, it is not
    correct to say that one is irrelevant and can be dropped? Correlation does *not*
    imply irrelevance, as there are easily producible examples of perfectly anti-correlated
    variables that are useless on their own but perfectly predictive in unison.

  * **An ability to communicate results clearly and succintly**. Although the day-to-day
    work of a data scientist is complex, she should be able to maintain the ability to
    regularly present her analysis in a way that is understandable to business stakeholders
    and that can have noticeable impact on organizational or product decisions.

    Amazing work left in the theoretical dustbin or completed without the final step
    of communicating the results and adjusting business coordination is next to useless.

    This goes hand-in-hand with the final trait: a love for storytelling.
